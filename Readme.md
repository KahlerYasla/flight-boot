# Backend Project with Spring Boot

This project is a backend application developed using Spring Boot. It follows a layer-based architecture instead of the common feature-based structure. The layer-based architecture promotes separation of concerns and modularity.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized into the following layers:

- **Controller Layer**: Contains the RESTful API endpoints that handle incoming requests and delegate the processing to the appropriate service layer.

- **Service Layer**: Implements the business logic of the application. It interacts with the repository layer to retrieve and manipulate data.

- **Repository Layer**: Handles data persistence and retrieval. It communicates with the database or any other data source.

- **Mapper Layer**: Provides mapping between different data models or entities. It helps in transforming data between layers and ensures loose coupling.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for building Java applications, providing a robust foundation for the backend development.

- **Spring MVC**: A module of the Spring framework that simplifies the development of RESTful APIs.

- **Spring Data JPA**: A module of the Spring framework that provides easy integration with databases using the Java Persistence API (JPA).

- **Mapper Framework**: A library or framework used for object-to-object mapping, such as MapStruct or ModelMapper.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`

2. Install the required dependencies: `mvn install`

3. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file.

4. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
